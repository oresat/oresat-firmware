/**

 * @brief    Main description and usage of TM HAL based libraries
 * @{
 *
 * \par About libraries
 *
 * These libraries are provided by Tilen MAJERLE and are developed under GNU GPL v3 licence. For more information about that, please check website of license.
 *
 * To use it, I suppose you know C language and at least basics of STM32 devices (especially STM32F0, STM32F4 or STM32F7 series).
 *
 * \par Download libraries
 *
 * Download for all libraries is on this link: http://stm32f4-discovery.net/?wpdmdl=2618
 *
 * \par Examples
 *
 * Each library has Keil uVision based example on my Github account, https://github.com/MaJerle/stm32fxxx_hal_libraries.
 *
 * If you are beginner, then I suggest you to download entire repository from Github, install basic demo version of Keil uVision and open examples directly from download.
 * Almost all examples works with demo version of Keil uVision.
 *
 * \par Libraries structure
 *
 * Each library is structured in the same way where you have these parts:
 *  - Header file:
 *    - Library description with link on website
 *    - Includes section
 *    - Defines section for different configurations in library
 *    - Enumerations and structures section
 *    - Function declaration section
 *  - Source file:
 *    - Function implementations
 *
 * Each library includes at least these 2 files:
 *  - stm32fxxx_hal.h file:
 *    This file was done by me for better organization between several STM32 families to use with my libraries for future use.
 *    It sets some basic defines, which can also be set using compiler's preprocessor defines. Check file for more information with detailed description.
 *
 *  - defines.h file:
 *    <b>This file is totally based on user and should also be created by user</b>.
 *
 *    It is used for library configuration settings, so you don't have to edit library file. 
 *    If you edit library file, then if new version is out, it will be overwritten what you don't wanna have.
 *
 *    Check example below for meaning.
 *
\code
//------------------------------------
//tm_stm32_exti.h file:
//------------------------------------
//Content in this file is similar to this below:

//Include defines.h file for user configuration
#include "defines.h"

//Set default NVIC preemption priority if not defined by user to 0x03
#ifndef EXTI_NVIC_PRIORITY
#define EXTI_NVIC_PRIORITY     0x03
#endif

//------------------------------------
//defines.h file: (set by user)
//------------------------------------

//User wants to change that, use defines.h file like this:
#ifndef DEFINES_FILE
#define DEFINES_FILE

//Let's set EXTI NVIC preemption priority to highest, so we will do:
#define EXTI_NVIC_PRIORITY    0x00

#endif
\endcode
 *
 * Code above shows how you can use defines.h file to change default library settings.
 *
 * \par HAL Source from ST
 *
 * TM HAL libraries works on STM32Cube provided from ST and are not included in package of libraries.
 *
 * @note  You have to go to ST website and download STM32Cube package for your family and use that STM32Fxxx_HAL_Drivers libraries in your project together with my libraries.
 *        On my Github, you have example how they are used together.
 *
 * \par About defines.h file
 *
 * Please check above about this.
