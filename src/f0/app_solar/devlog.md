# Dev Log

## TODO
1. Implement conventional perturb and observe algorithm.
    - Possibly similar to the one found in fig 6 of this [PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772671124003875#eqn0005)

2. Optimize the algorithm as noted in that study or any other modified pao studies. 

## Notes
- generateCsv uses a loop, but iterate_mppt_perturb_and_observe does not, reason?
